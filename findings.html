    <h1> My Personal Portfolio</h1>
    <img class="image" src="Image/portfolio.png" />
    <p class="description-bg"> I have been developed many websites before. However, this is my first portfolio website that I have developed for myself as well as having to actually go through the entire development process from research to testing. Overall, the whole development process is really interesting and fun. Below are the different individual piece of research and testing that I have done throughout the development process. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> Prior to the interview, I create a set of questions to ask my potential users for their opinion. This is important because it will ensure that all the design, layout and feature that I plan to implement into a portfolio are actually what the user wants to see and use. In addition, during the interview, the majority of the questions I asked are mostly focused on the design and content of my portfolio because I believe that the best portfolio needs to have a great design and interesting contents. Those are the two important things that will attract people to my website. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> During this development process, I spend a considered amount of time browsing through different portfolio from a game-developer to a web-designer in order to look at their design styles such as feature, layout, and content. In addition, I also analysis different software services and features offered by third-party website builder like SquareSpace. This gives me an idea of the types of website that are generated by the web builder. Ultimately, the whole process helps me learn more about the competitors’ strengths and weaknesses in their design. In another word, It allows me to know what work and what doesn’t in other people portfolio as I try to develop my own. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> After finishing my research, I have written down a list of different features/function that I planned to implement into my website. Some of those features are recommended by the user during the interview, the rest is based on other people portfolio in the competitor analysis as well as my own personal experience in web development. After writing all the features down, I rate each of them from 1(high) to 5(low) according to their value to my websites such as business value, user value, and development effort. This allows me to prioritize the importance of different features based on their rating.  </p>

          <p class="description-text"> Each of the features is prioritized base on its value to my portfolio, ranging from user and business value to a development effort. Those values are mostly base on the user research, website requirement as well as my personal opinions and experiences. Moreover, I also plot those features into graph by their values to make it easier to see. So, as I developed my portfolio, I will keep in mind the importance of each feature and incorporated them into my website according. Basically, this will help ensure that all of the must-have features are getting incorporated into the interface. For instance, Navigation Bar will be one of the first features that I need to incorporate into my interface due to its high priority. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> During the walkthrough, I ask the users to perform a series of tasks, which mostly focus on the important aspects of my portfolio. Then, I have set of follow up questions to ask for their opinions. I think this whole process is really important to gain some insight into users’ behaviors and perspective about my website. For instance, it helps me identify any potential usability issues base on their action as they try to accomplish the task. In addition, with the user feedback, I can make any necessary adjustment or improvement to my portfolio in order to make it more user-friendly. While conduct cognitive walkthrough, one of the problems that I have is that the users have a tendency to scroll through my website when it first load, which make some of the tasks such as finding a Send Mail button become irrelevant. Therefore, I have to make sure that the users can only perform the task that a given to them. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> Most of the stories are an extension of my features list. For each of them, I wrote a short description of different scenarios where the user will be utilizing the functionality of each feature. This is really important for the development because it allows me to solidify the goal of the feature as well as having a better understanding of the user desire in the end product. Thanks to my user research and testing, such as user interview and cognitive walkthrough, I was able to come up with many of these amazing user stories for this part of the development process. </p>

        <h2> User Test </h2>
        <p class="description-bg"> Overall, all the user tests have provided me with a lot of useful data on what to improve my portfolio. However, some feedback from the results is not great. For instance, the results of the Click Test doesn’t tell me much about the actual reason why they Click there or how to improve on it. Most of the answers on “why did you click there?” are too vague. Basically, the only information I know from the click test is where they click on the screen from the heat map. In the end, I have to end up spending some time interpreting the reason for some of the clicks.  </p>

            <p class="description-text">  In my opinion, the background section is the most important part of my website. Therefore, I want to create the question test in order to get more feedback from the user perspective about the design and the layout of this section. Look at the result, it seems to receive a lot of great advice on many different ways to improve and make an adjustment that I can make for this section of my website. For example, one of the advice is to move the Send Mail button to a Contact section. </p>

            <p class="description-text"> Before developing this test, I realized that there might be a problem for some people to locate my code for all the projects. Therefore, I end up creating the click test because I think this is perfect test to see if the users are able to navigate and see all my projects code. Not surprisingly, it seems like my hunch is correct because mostly a lot of people are unable to find it according to the result.  </p>

            <p class="description-text"> I utilize the navigation test to focus on the responsiveness aspect of my website. Basically, this test has helped me ensuring the usability of my website on different media devices. In another word, it will allow me to know if the user can actually navigate to different sections of my website. From the result, it seems like the majority of people are able to successfully completing this task. </p>

    <div class="section-content">
      <div class="description">
        <p class="text-indent"> Throughout my researching process, I was able to gain a lot of useful insight on how to design my own personal website. For instance, conducting a competitor analysis allow me to see a lot of unique design choice as well as interesting features from other people portfolio. In addition, during the user interview, I was able to receive a lot of great advice from many users like which features should be implemented or what type of information should be displayed. After conducting my research, I found that a lot of people prefer a more simplistic scrollable design portfolio. However, it shouldn’t be so simple that the website become too plain, where nothing on the website is appealing to the users. Basically, it should have features that will capture the user’s attention. Lastly, the portfolio needs to reflect a little bit of my own personality and characteristic in it.  </p>
        <p class="text-indent"> So, after constructing my website, I begin the user testing portion, which has provided me with many quality feedbacks on how to improve upon my original interface. For example, in the cognitive walkthrough, one of the criticisms I received is that besides loading animation, there is nothing else in my portfolio that are interesting or appealing enough to capture user attention. Besides that, from the click-based usability test, I realized that there is a problem with the placement of Link to Project Code because not a lot of people are able to find it. Those are just a few things that the user testing have helped me identify. Based those findings, I am able to learn about the different flaw and weakness of my portfolio, which I can make an improvement on it. </p>
        <p class="text-indent"> Overall, both of the research and testing have played an important role in influence my design as I developed and improve my own portfolio. However, there is still some challenge that I have faced when conducting my research and testing. In my first interview, for some of the questions, the user gives me a general answer without giving a specific reason why. As the results, I end up have to rephrase some of the questions in a way that it will force the users to elaborate more in their answers, so I can extract more useful information from the responses.  </p>

      <h2> Incorporation of Findings </h2>

    <div class="section-content">
      <div class="description">
        <p class="text-indent">  After the conducting my research, I have implemented a lot of my initial findings into my portfolio. For example, I was able to develop a scrollable website with a navigation bar that can perform smooth scrolling. However, I must say that this particular feature, smooth scrolling, is little bit challenge for me to develop. As the results, I have to spend a lot of time looking at different documentation and example in order to have a rough idea of how to create it. Besides that feature, I have added a loading animation to my homepage in order to capture the user attention. Those are just a few examples that I have incorporated into the interface. However, my website from the midterm is still far from the finish. I believe there is still some room for it improves.  </p>
        <p class="text-indent"> So after that, I have conducted the user testing on my portfolio, which I was able to receive a lot of useful information from the user feedbacks and behaviors. Base on those findings, I have incorporated a lot of them into my website. For instance, I will implement the loading animation for all of my sections, so it will capture the user attention as they scroll through my website. This particular will be a little challenging because I will need to determine whether the user is currently looking at the section in order to trigger the loading animation. Another improvement is to shorten most of the text and add more images in order to make the design more appealing to the eye of users. In addition, redesign the layout of my project section as well as adding in a contact section are also part of my improvement. Of course, there are also some minor changes that I have fix for my website like correcting spell error. </p>
        <p class="text-indent"> However, I will not be able to incorporate all of my findings into my website due to a variety of reasons such as time constraints or difficult to implement. For example, Implementing the day and night mode toggle capability for the site. The idea of the feature is really interesting and unique, but it requires a lot of development effort in creating it. As the results, I decided to not implement that particular feature now and do it later. In the future, I will try to continue to maintain and make some improvement in the design of my portfolio.  </p>
