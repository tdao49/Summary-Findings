    <p class="site-description"> I have been developed many website before. However, this is my first portfolio website that I have develop for myself as well as having to actually going through the entire development process from research to testing. Overall, the whole development
      process is really interesting and fun. Belows are the different individual piece of research and testing that I have done throughout the development process. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> Prior to the interview, I create a set of questions to ask my potential users for their opinion. This is important because it will ensure that all the design, layout and feature that I plan to implement into a portfolio are actually what the user want to see and use. In addition, in the interview, the questions I asked are mostly focus on the design and content of my portfolio because I believes having a great design and interesting contents are essential for every portfolio. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> During this development process, I spend a considered amount of time browsing through different portfolio from a game-developer to a web-designer in order to look at their design style such as feature, layout and content. In addition, I also analysis different software services and features offered by third-party website builder like SquareSpace. This whole process helps me learn more about the competitors’ strengths and weaknesses in their design. Ultimately, it allows me to know what work and what doesn’t in other people portfolio as I try to develop my own. </p>

Those values are mostly base on the user research, website requirement as well as my personal opinions and experiences. As I developed my portfolio, I will keep in mind the importance of each features and incorporated them in to my website according. Basically, this will help ensure that all of the must-have features are getting incorporate to the interface. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> After finishing with my research, I wrote down different features/function that I planned to implement into my website. Some of those features are recommended by the user during interview, the rest are based on other people portfolio in the competitor analysis as well as my own personal experience in web development. After writing all the features down, I rate each of them from 1(high) to 5(low) according to their value to my website such as business value, user value and development effort. </p>

          <p class="description-text"> During the walkthrough, I ask the user to perform a series of tasks, which mostly focus on the important aspects of my portfolio. Then, I have set of follow up questions for user opinion and perspective. This whole process is really important to gain some insight on user’s behavior. For instance, it helps me identify any potential usability issues base on their action as they try to accomplish the task. In addition, with the user feedback, I can make any necessary adjustment or improvement to my portfolio in order to make it more user-friendly. While conduct cognitive walkthrough, I also need to ensure that the users only perform task that a given to them. For instance, if the user has scroll through the whole website first, some of my tasks, such as finding a Send Mail button, would be irrelevant.  </p>

This is important because it allow me to solidify the goal of each features as well as having a better understanding about the end-user desire in my product. Most of the stories are draw inspiration from my user research and testing such as user interview and cognitive walkthrough. Those development process have play an important role in helping me creating these user stories. </p>

Most of the answer is on “why did you click there?” are too vague. Basically, the only information I know from the click test is where they click on the screen from the heat map. In the end, I have to end-up spending a lot of time interpret the reason for each of their click.  </p>

      <h2> Summary of Findings </h2>
      <hr/>
    </header>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p class="text-indent"> Throughout my researching process, I was able to gain a lot of useful insight in how to design my own personal website. For instance, conducting a competitor analysis allow me to see a lot of unique design choice as well as interesting features from other people portfolio. In addition, during the user interview, I was able to receive many great advices from different user like which features should be implement or what type of information should be displayed. After conducting my research, I found that a lot of people prefer a more simplistic scrollable design website. However, it shouldn’t be so simple that the website become too plain, where nothing on the website is appealing to the users. It should have features that can capture the user’s attention. Lastly, the portfolio need to be reflect a little bit of my own personality and characteristic in it. </p>
      <p class="text-indent"> So, after construct my website, I begin the user testing portion, which have provided me with many quality feedbacks on how to improve upon my original interface. For example, in the cognitive walkthrough, one of the criticisms I received is that besides loading animation, there are nothing else in my portfolio that are interesting or appealing enough to capture user attention. Besides that, from the click-based usability test, I realized that there is a problem with placement of Link to Project Code because not a lot of people are able to find it. Those are just a few examples that the user testing has help me identifying them. Based those findings, I will be able learn about the different flaw and weakness of my portfolio, hence I can make a significant improvement on it. </p>
      <p class="text-indent"> Overall, both of the research and testing have play an important role in influence my design as I developed and improve upon my own portfolio. However, there are still some challenge that I have faced when conducting my research and testing. In my first interview, for some of the questions, the user gives me a general answer without giving a specific reason why. As the results, I end up have to rephrase some of the questions in a way that it will force the users to elaborate more in their answers, so I can extract more useful information from the responses. </p>

      <h2> Incorporation of Findings </h2>
      <hr/>
    </header>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p class="text-indent"> After the conducting my research, I have implemented a lot of my initial findings into my portfolio. For example, I was able to develop a scrollable website with a navigation bar that can perform smooth scrolling. This particular feature, smooth scrolling, is little bit challenge for me to develop. As the results, I have to spend a lot of time looking at different documentation as well as different example in order to a rough idea on how to create it. Beside that feature, I have added a loading animation to my homepage in order to capture the user attention. Those are just a few examples of the findings from the user research that I have incorporate into the interface. However, my website is still far from finish. I believe there is still some room for it improve. After that, I have performed user testing on my website. </p>
      <p class="text-indent"> While conducting the test, I was able to receive a lot of usefully information from the user feedbacks and behaviors. Base on those findings, I am planning to incorporate a lot of them into my website. For instance, I will implement the loading animation for all of my sections, so it will capture the user attention as they scroll through my website. This particular will be a little challenging because I will need to determine whether the user is currently look at the section viewport in order to trigger the loading animation. Another improvement that I plan to make is to shorten most of the text and add more images in order to make design more appealing to the users. In addition, redesign the layout of my project section is also part of my plan. Of course, there are more minor improvement that I need to make for my website.</p>
      <p class="text-indent"> However, I will not be able to incorporate all of my findings into my website due to a variety of different reasons such as time constraints or it is too difficult to implement. For example, day/night toggle mode. The idea of the feature is really interesting and unique, but it requires a lot development effort in creating it. As the results, I will not implement that feature now and will do it later in the future. </p>
